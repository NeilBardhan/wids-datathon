    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The WiDS Datathon 2022 focuses on a prediction task involving roughly 100k observations of **building energy usage records** collected over 7 years and a number of states within the United States. The dataset consists of building characteristics (e.g. floor area, facility type etc), weather data for the location of the building (e.g. annual average temperature, annual total precipitation etc) as well as the energy usage for the building and the given year, measured as **Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site EUI)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each row in the data corresponds to the a single building observed in a given year**. The task is to **predict the Site EUI for each row**, given the characteristics of the building and the weather data for the location of the building."
